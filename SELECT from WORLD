PROBLEM 1:
Observe the result of running this SQL command to show the name, continent and population of all countries.

CODE:
SELECT name, continent, population FROM world -- Simply showing the name, continent, and population columns from the world table

PROBLEM 2:
Show the name for the countries that have a population of at least 200 million. 
200 million is 200000000, there are eight zeros.

CODE:
SELECT name FROM world -- SELECT the name columns from the world table.
WHERE population >= 200000000 - Only show me the names that have a population greater than or equal to 200 million.

PROBLEM 3:
Give the name and the per capita GDP for those countries with a population of at least 200 million.

CODE:
SELECT name, gdp/population - SELECT the name, and calculate the per capita GDP from the world table
FROM world
WHERE population >= 200000000 - Show only the names with population greater than or equal to 200 million

PROBLEM 4:
Show the name and population in millions for the countries of the continent 'South America'. 
Divide the population by 1000000 to get population in millions.

CODE:
SELECT name, population/1000000 -- SELECT name, and population in millions
FROM world
WHERE continent = 'South America' -- Only where the continent is South America

PROBLEM 5:
Show the name and population for France, Germany, Italy

CODE:
SELECT name, population -- SELECT name and population
FROM world
WHERE name IN('France','Germany','Italy') - Only for France, Germany, and Italy

PROBLEM 6:
Show the countries which have a name that includes the word 'United'

CODE:
SELECT name -- SELECT name
FROM world
WHERE name LIKE 'United%' -- Only show countries with a name that begins with 'United' such as United Kingdom

PROBLEM 7:
Two ways to be big: 
A country is big if it has an area of more than 3 million sq km or it has a population of more than 250 million.
Show the countries that are big by area or big by population. Show name, population and area.

CODE:
SELECT name, population, area -- SELECT name, population, and area
FROM world
WHERE population >= 250000000 OR area >= 3000000 -- Only show the aforementioned criteria for countries with a population greater than (or equal to) 250 million 
-- or an area greater than (or equal to) 3 million sq km

PROBLEM 8:
Exclusive OR (XOR). Show the countries that are big by area or big by population but not both. Show name, population and area.

Australia has a big area but a small population, it should be included.
Indonesia has a big population but a small area, it should be included.
China has a big population and big area, it should be excluded.
United Kingdom has a small population and a small area, it should be excluded.

CODE:
SELECT name, population, area --SELECT name, population, and area
FROM world
WHERE population >= 250000000 XOR area >= 3000000 -- Like the previous problem except now we need countries who fit one of these criteria NOT BOTH.

PROBLEM 9:
Show the name and population in millions and the GDP in billions for the countries of the continent 'South America'. 
Use the ROUND function to show the values to two decimal places.
For South America show population in millions and GDP in billions both to 2 decimal places.

CODE:
SELECT name, ROUND(population/1000000,2), ROUND(gdp/1000000000,2) -- SELECT name, show the population in millions and ROUND it to two decimal places, show the gpd in billions and ROUND it to two decimal places. 
FROM world
WHERE continent = 'South America' -- Show the above criteria only for countries in South America.

PROBLEM 10:
Show the name and per-capita GDP for those countries with a GDP of at least one trillion (1000000000000; that is 12 zeros). 
Round this value to the nearest 1000.

CODE:
SELECT name, ROUND(gdp/population,-3) -- SELECT name, and ROUND the per capita GDP to the nearest 1000
FROM world
WHERE gdp >= 1000000000000 -- Show the above criteria only for countries with a gdp greater than or equal to one trillion.

PROBLEM 11:
Greece has capital Athens.
Each of the strings 'Greece', and 'Athens' has 6 characters.
Show the name and capital where the name and the capital have the same number of characters.

CODE:
SELECT name, capital -- SELECT name, capital from world table
FROM world
WHERE LENGTH(name) = LENGTH(capital) -- Only show the above criteria if the length of the country's name matches the same length as their respective capital's name.

PROBLEM 12:
The capital of Sweden is Stockholm. Both words start with the letter 'S'.

Show the name and the capital where the first letters of each match. Don't include countries where the name and the capital are the same word.
You can use the function LEFT to isolate the first character.
You can use <> as the NOT EQUALS operator.

CODE:
SELECT name, capital -- RETURN the name and capital
FROM world
WHERE LEFT(name, 1) = LEFT(capital,1) AND name <> capital -- Only return the name and capital if the first letter of their names match AND if they aren't the same word.

PROBLEM 13:
Equatorial Guinea and Dominican Republic have all of the vowels (a e i o u) in the name. 
They don't count because they have more than one word in the name.
Find the country that has all the vowels and no spaces in its name.
You can use the phrase name NOT LIKE '%a%' to exclude characters from your results.
The query shown misses countries like Bahamas and Belarus because they contain at least one 'a'

CODE:
SELECT name -- Return country
   FROM world
WHERE name LIKE '%a%' -- Name must contain the following vowels and no spaces.
AND name LIKE '%e%'
AND name LIKE '%i%'
AND name LIKE '%o%'
AND name LIKE '%u%'
  AND name NOT LIKE '% %'
