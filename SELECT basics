PROBLEM 1:

The example uses a WHERE clause to show the population of 'France'. 
Note that strings (pieces of text that are data) should be in 'single quotes';
Modify it to show the population of Germany

CODE:
SELECT population FROM world -- SELECTING the population column from the table world
WHERE name = 'Germany' -- Show the population where name equals 'Germany'

PROBLEM 2:

Checking a list The word IN allows us to check if an item is in a list. 
The example shows the name and population for the countries 'Brazil', 'Russia', 'India' and 'China'.
Show the name and the population for 'Sweden', 'Norway' and 'Denmark'.

CODE: 
SELECT name, population FROM world -- SELECTING the name and population columns from the table world
WHERE name IN ('Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark'); -- Show the name and population for any cities in the following list

PROBLEM 3:

Which countries are not too small and not too big? 
BETWEEN allows range checking (range specified is inclusive of boundary values). 
The example below shows countries with an area of 250,000-300,000 sq. km. 
Modify it to show the country and the area for countries with an area between 200,000 and 250,000.

CODE:
SELECT name, area FROM world -- SELECT the name column and area column from the table world
WHERE area BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000 -- Show cities with an area between 200,000 and 250,000
